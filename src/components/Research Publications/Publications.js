              title="Addressing Spend Leakage and Optimization of Cloud Costs"
              description="IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), 2024, Washington DC, USA."
              abstract="Spend leakage in a cloud estate manifests in many forms and requires a careful analysis of various metrics. We present a suite of features to detect such behavior and provide recommendations for optimization. We apply the proposed solution in practice by presenting a real-world case-study. Through this case-study we demonstrate how many cases of spend leakage go unnoticed by simple handles to manage cloud estate and how the solutions proposed in the paper can enable the business with better foresight and control on the cloud costs."

              title="Mining Patterns for Proactive Management of Procure-to-Pay Exceptions"
              description="IEEE ICDMW 2024, Abu Dhabi."
              abstract="This paper explores a novel approach to addressing exceptions in the procure-to-pay (P2P) process by analyzing recurring patterns that cause procurement inefficiencies. The P2P process, which involves issuing purchase orders, receiving goods, and validating invoices through three-way matching, often encounters exceptions such as pricing discrepancies, quantity mismatches, and missing documentation. These issues can lead to delays, financial errors, and strained supplier relationships. Existing black-box models such as neural networks, while effective at detection of exceptions, lack transparency. On the other hand, traditional white-box methods such as classification trees fall short in identifying complex patterns that drive recurring exceptions. This paper presents an enhanced white-box solution, which improves the generation and prioritization of classification rules by optimizing the depth, coverage, and explainability of patterns. The proposed method allows for more accurate and comprehensive exception management, empowering procurement teams to make informed decisions with greater transparency."
